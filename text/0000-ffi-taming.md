# Summary

One para explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the language to understand, and for somebody familiar with the compiler to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.

# How We Teach This

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this idea best presented? As a continuation of existing Pony patterns, or as a wholly new one?

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the Pony guides must be re-organized or altered? Does it change how Pony is taught to new users at any level?

How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing Pony users?

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

What parts of the design are still TBD?
